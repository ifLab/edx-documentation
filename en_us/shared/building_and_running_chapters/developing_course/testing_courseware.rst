.. _Testing Your Course Content:

###########################
测试您的课程内容
###########################

在Studio的在线课程中，学生和您看到的界面是不同的。

我们建议您建好课程后持续进行测试，这样您就可以和用学生的视角体验课程。

以下步骤测试您的内容：

* `Preview Course Content`_
* `View Your Live Course`_

.. note:: 
  如果您建立内容组将课程内容设置为部分学生可见，请参考 :ref:`Preview Cohort Specific
  Courseware`.

更多关于贝塔测试的内容请参考
:ref:`Beta_Testing`.

.. _Preview Course Content:

*************************
预览课程内容
*************************

您可以在课程上线或发布特定单元之前预览课程内容，这样您就可以审查课程将如何呈现在学生面前。
 
当您预览课程内容时，您将在Studio看到最新的课程内容。
您将看到单元的发布状态： :ref:`Draft
(Never Published)`、 :ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)` 或 :ref:`Visible to
Staff Only` 。

如果您使用内容小组并指定单元中的组件仅对特定小组可见，可见性状态指某些单元中的内容仅对特定小组可见。
更多关于预览仅对特定小组可见的课程内容，请参阅 :ref:`Preview Cohort Specific Courseware`.

例如，您可以 :ref:`publish a unit<Publish a Unit>` ，其中可以包含视频和讨论区。

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-studio.png
 :alt: A unit in Studio with a video and discussion

学生在学习管理系统中将看到相同内容。

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-lms.png
 :alt: A unit in the LMS with a video and discussion

如果您稍后决定在讨论之前往单元中添加多选题。
在发布修改之前，您可以通过预览单元查看该问题将如何呈现在学生界面。

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-studio-added-comp.png
 :alt: A unit in Studio with a video and multiple choice problem. (The
   discussion component below the multiple choice problem is not included in
   the screen capture).

点击 **预览** 然后选择以 **学生** 视角浏览课程。您将看到学习管理系统中的单元包含的多选题。
预览中将呈现您在 :ref:`publish the
change<Publish a Unit>` 之后学生所看到的界面。

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-lms-added-comp.png
 :alt: A unit in the LMS with "View as Student" selected, showing a video and
  a multiple choice problem. (The discussion component below the multiple
  choice problem is not included in the screen capture).

在线课程中，学生仍将看到原有的课程内容。只有您 :ref:`publish the change<Publish a Unit>` ，之后，学生才能看到多选题。

.. note:: When the unit's state is :ref:`Published and Live`, the preview and
   the live version of the courseware are exactly the same. Selecting either
   of **View Live** or **Preview** gives you the same view.


 
.. _View Your Live Course:

******************************************
查看在线课程
******************************************

当您使用Studio时，您可以通过在学习管理系统中浏览课程进行测试。
您可以使用 `Staff View`_ 和 `Student View`_ 浏览课程。
如果您使用内容组将内容设置为特定小组可见，您也可以以小组成员视角查看内容。

当您使用Studio时，您可以由以下两种方式切换至学生视角：

* 在大纲页面中点击 **在线查看**
   
  .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-outline-view-live.png
   :alt: View live button on the outline

* 在单元页面中点击 **查看在线版本**
   
  .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-view-live.png
   :alt: View Live Version button on the unit page

=================
员工视角
=================

您可以用 **员工视角** 查看内容。

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Live_Course_Staff_View.png
 :alt: Image of the Courseware page in a live course with Staff View indicated
  at top right and a View Unit in Studio button
 
In **Staff View**:

* You see all units that are :ref:`Published and Live`. For units that are
  :ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)` or :ref:`Visible to Staff Only`, you
  see the last published version of the unit. You see these units
  regardless of the release dates of the containing section or subsection.

* You do not see units that are :ref:`Draft (Never Published)`. To
  see these units, you must use Preview mode as described in :ref:`Preview
  Course Content`.

* You can access the Instructor Dashboard, which has features and reports that
  help you :ref:`run your course<Running Your Course Index>`.

When you view your course in **Staff View**, you can execute tests to make sure
that your course works the way you intend. For example,  before the release
date of a subsection, members of the course team can work through the problems
to verify that the correct answer gets a green check for correct, and that any
answer other than the correct one gets a red X for incorrect.

============
Student View
============

When viewing your course in the LMS, you can use the **Student** view to see the
course with all course content that is intended for all students.

.. note:: If you have enabled your course for cohorts and have designated some
  content as visible only to certain content groups, you can select a content
  group from the **View Course As** drop down list to see the content exactly
  as a student in a cohort associated with that content group will see it. For
  details, see :ref:`Preview Cohort Specific Courseware`.

To switch to the **Student** view, click **View this course as** and select
**Student** from the drop down list.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-view-as-student.png
 :alt: Image of the View Course As drop down list with Staff, Student, and
  named content group options

In **Student View**:

* You do not see sections or subsections that have not yet been released.

* If the section and subsection are released, you see units that are
  :ref:`Published and Live`. For units that are
  :ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)`, you see the last published version of the
  unit. 

* You do not see units that are :ref:`Draft (Never Published)` or
  :ref:`Visible to Staff Only`. To see these units, you must switch back to Instructor view or use Preview mode as described in :ref:`Preview Course Content`.

* You can access the Instructor Dashboard, which has features and reports that
  help you run your course.

Open Studio from Your Live Course

When you are viewing your course in the LMS as **Staff View**, you can open
Studio directly.
   
* In a unit page, click **View Unit in Studio**.
  
  .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Live_Studio_from_LMS_Unit.png
