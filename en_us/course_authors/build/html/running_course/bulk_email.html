<p>For courses on edx.org, you can send bulk email messages to course participants
directly from the Instructor Dashboard. Messages can use HTML styling, and can
include links to videos, social media pages for the course, and other material.
All course contributors who are assigned the course staff or instructor role
can use bulk emails to communicate with course participants before, during, and
after the course run.</p>

<div class="section" id="message-addressing">
<h2>10.6.1. Message Addressing<a class="headerlink" href="#message-addressing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you send an email message from the Instructor Dashboard, you choose its
recipients by selecting one of these predefined groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Myself</strong>, to test out a message before sending it to a larger group.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Staff and Instructors</strong>, to contact other members of the administrative
team.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>All (students, staff and instructors)</strong>, to communicate with currently
enrolled students and the administrative team.</p>
<p>Email messages are sent to all enrolled students with these exceptions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Students who have not replied to the account activation email message
that is sent when they registered on edx.org.</li>
<li>Students who have opted out of receiving email messages through the <strong>Email
Settings</strong> link, which is present for each course on the <strong>Current
Courses</strong> dashboard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you use the bulk email feature, consider that messages <strong>cannot be
canceled</strong> after they are sent. If you plan to send a message to all course
participants, be sure to review each draft carefully, and send the message to
yourself first for thorough testing.</p>

Hello %%USER_FULLNAME%%,

Great job working through week {number}! As you know, the {course number}
exam is next week. If you missed a problem set, you can still earn a
certificate. Each problem set is worth only {number}% of the overall grade,
but this exam is worth {number}%.

Please read this important information about the exam before you begin taking
it.

* The exam starts on {date} at {time} UTC and must be finished by {date} at
  {time} UTC. Plan your schedule accordingly.

* Be sure that you know what time the UTC deadline is in your time zone. See
  the current UTC time {add link}. No extensions will be given.

* The exam is not timed. You can start, stop, and come back to it until the
  deadline.

* Each exam question allows only one answer submission. If you accidentally
  click &quot;Check&quot;, that problem cannot be reset for you.

* The exam covers everything (video lectures, reading, and problem sets) from
  weeks {number}-{number}. If you missed any of these materials, you will
  want to review them before you take the exam.

* You can use the textbook and the Internet to clarify your knowledge of exam
  topics, as long as you are not deliberately looking up answers to exam
  questions.

* Course discussions will remain open during the exam, but anyone who posts
  an answer to an exam question will be violating the honor code and risk
  being removed from the class, forfeiting the certificate.

* If you need to alert the staff to an issue with the exam while the exam is
  open, add a post to the General discussion topic and include [EXAM] in
  the subject line.

* Check the Course Info page periodically. It is the fastest way the
  staff has to communicate any delays, corrections, or changes.

Good luck!

  While you may see the link in a few days, it can take up to two weeks edX
  to generate all of the course certificates.

* The {course number} discussions close on {date} at {time} UTC. You will not
